    <h2 class="md-title">The new tool stack</h2>
    <p>
        The new .NET tool stack includes the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli" target="_blank">dotnet command line tool<md-icon class="external-link">launch</md-icon></a>, <code>xproj</code> project structure and JSON configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to take most existing applications, targeting .NET 4.5.1 or later and convert them to use this new structure. This is done by creating a new .NET Core project, editing the <code>project.json</code> file to change the
        <code>frameworks</code> section to target <code>net451</code> (<a href="https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/ICanHasDotnetCore/blob/master/Web/project.json" target="_blank">example<md-icon class="external-link">launch</md-icon></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This website (<a href="https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/ICanHasDotnetCore" target="_blank">source<md-icon class="external-link">launch</md-icon></a>) uses the new tooling, but targets .NET 4.6.1 as not all our dependencies have been ported to .NET Standard.
        The new tooling supports targeting multiple platforms, so each project can be gradually be converted to also target .NET Standard when appropriate.
    </p>
    <h2 class="md-title">.NET Standard</h2>
    <p>
        .NET Standard Library is a set of APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET runtimes. Applications targeting .NET Standard should run on all platforms that implement that standard.
        See the refer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library" target="_blank">.NET Standard Library<md-icon class="external-link">launch</md-icon></a> documentation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="md-title">How does this work?</h2>
    We read your <code>packages.config</code> file and recursively lookup up those packages and their dependencies on
    nuget.org. We then look at whether there are any <code>.NETStandard</code> dependencies. Since what was the base class
    library is now referenced via nuget, the majority of .NETStandard assemblies reference at least one package.

    <h2 class="md-title">Do you keep any uploaded information?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, but in a non-identifying way. We keep a count of how many time a packages found on nuget.org is appears in a result set.
        We do not track the names of packages that were not recognised, as these would typically be from internal nuget feeds.

        We also use google analytics to track page views and time one site.
