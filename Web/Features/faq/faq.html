    <h2 class="md-title">How does this work?</h2>
    We read your <code>packages.config</code> file and recursively lookup up those packages and their dependencies on
    nuget.org. We then look at whether there are any <code>.NETStandard</code> dependencies. Since what was the base class
    library is now referenced via nuget, the majority of .NETStandard assemblies reference at least one package.

    <h2 class="md-title">Do you keep any uploaded information?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, but in a non-identifying way. We keep track of which packages have not yet been ported to .NET Standard, and a
        count of how many times that package was referenced. We do not track the names of packages that were not recognised,
        as these would typically be from internal nuget feeds.

        We also use google analytics to track page views and time one site.
